"I worked on a StockTradePro(Zerodha Clone )project where I built an interactive and responsive UI using React, Material UI, and Bootstrap. It features real-time data updates and a smooth user experience, integrated with a Node.js and MongoDB backend. This project helped me gain deep insights into financial web applications and performance optimization."
